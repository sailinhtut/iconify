1. Define Clear Architecture and Document Internal Best Practices üìÉ One of the
most important things is bringing all the team members on the same page.
Especially when onboarding new team members, questions like these might pop up:
‚ÄúI need to update the design system, where in code should I do it?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do we
handle API errors on the business logic layer?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo we have best practices for
conditional rendering of Widgets?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat kind of tests should I write for this
feature?‚Äù Ideally most of the questions should be answered by your thorough
documentation of the architecture and best practices in your team. However, If
your team is still in a phase without strictly set best-practices and lacking
documentation, I highly encourage you to try the following: Set up a meeting
with your dev team where you discuss all the different parts of the app ‚Äî from
state management to widgets and above. Analyze, research and finally define the
first set of guidelines (in written form) which you think would eliminate most
of the insecurities & questions that keep appearing within your team. Try to put
the first iteration of guidelines into practice (e.g. in your next sprint).
After a while observe the results and talk again with your team about the parts
that were useful but also try to find the parts which were too loosely defined
or incomplete. Continuously iterate the documentation as necessary. Also, don‚Äôt
forget to iterate (refactor) the parts of code which are problematic in the
first place and for which no amount of documentation would shed enough light on.
Consistency is key. And consistency comes with guidelines. Find and define your
standard best-practices, which will help your team to be confident about the ins
and outs of your codebase. TIP: You can use free tools such as Notion to
document these best-practice s. I am also a huge fan of architectural diagrams ‚Äî
presenting the architectural parts in a easy-to-digest visual format. One of the
nice free visual tools that you could use for diagrams is Figma/FigJam. 2.
Separate Business and UI Logic From my experience ‚Äî this one is a must. I dare
to say that it‚Äôs almost impossible to keep widgets clean if you intertwine
Business & UI logic. If business logic is laying around in your widgets and your
app is growing ‚Üí it‚Äôs time to find a state management solution! :) Benefits of
Separation: makes it easy to test both UI & business logic layers separately
much easier refactoring faster debugging faster implementation of new features
Based on my personal experience, I can highly recommend the BLOC state
management package. It‚Äôs mature and flexible enough so it‚Äôs suitable for almost
every use-case. If you‚Äôre afraid of the possible boilerplate code (that you‚Äôve
heard about) which comes with BLOC ‚Üí you can read Flutter: BLOCs at Scale | 2 ‚Äî
Keeping BLOCs Lean, where I discuss how you can utilize concepts like reusable
BLOCs, which will lower the amount of boilerplate. If your app doesn‚Äôt need all
the possibilities of BLOC, you can use Cubit (included in the same package). 3.
Limit Widget‚Äôs Render Function to ~60 Lines of Code Your team will have large
problems if your widgets are a giant pile of code. The limit of ~60 Lines of
Code is just my favorite personal guideline which forced me and my team to keep
widgets well structured and clear. Thanks to the extraordinary designer Sabina
Mowich (https://www.behance.net/gallery/131947637/Mobile-Banking-UI-design) for
allowing me to use her design üé® The above image shows an example of how we
could structure our widgets on the screen-level while keeping the amount of code
minimal. Logically dividing the UI into multiple sub-sections and sub-widgets
helps us achieve a clear and well maintainable set of UI code. Still curious why
the widget‚Äôs size can become such a big problem? code reviewing only one widget
with 300+ lines of code will probably ‚Äúmentally exhaust‚Äù the reviewer to such a
degree, that he might easily forget about his deep-work session afterwards.
implementing simple UI design changes becomes cumbersome, when you‚Äôre 5 minutes
straight searching for the right piece of code that needs your edits. it
discourages reusability of widgets and promotes code duplication. TIP: Having
multiple smaller widgets is much better than having a single large one. Also,
use class widgets instead of functions (for performance reasons). NOTE: If you
are curious how to write clean widgets and keep your UI code structured, be sure
to press the follow button on my profile. I will be soon covering that topic
in-depth. 4. Create API Wrappers around Packages When you read a package‚Äôs
documentation, it usually shows the direct usage of the package‚Äôs API. This
confuses especially less experienced devs by making them think that polluting
the codebase with direct calls of a package‚Äôs function in random places is good
practice. Except that it usually isn‚Äôt ‚Äî here‚Äôs why: imagine you want to replace
the package with a similar one ‚Äî now you need to refactor all the calls across
your whole codebase ‚Üí a very mundane & bug prone process. through time packages
are subject to breaking changes, which means that we need to change them all
across the code (similar issues as in the above point). makes it more difficult
to write tests. Instead you should opt for wrapping service classes, which are
flexible and easy to maintain. Example: Let‚Äôs assume we want to implement
analytics in our app. After installing the analytics package of our choice (e.g.
firebase_analytics), let‚Äôs create a AnalyticsService wrapper service class. This
way we can define our own API and stay flexible in regards to future package
changes. This class could look something like this: A comparison of the direct
usage of the package VS usage of the service class: TIP: Loose coupling delivers
obvious benefits in flexibility and extensibility. The caveat of slight overhead
(which is boilerplate code) is irrelevant compared to long-term benefits. 5.
Automate CI/CD Last but not least ‚Äî setting up the CI/CD pipeline. It‚Äôs very
important to have a nice ‚Äúimplement-test-merge-deploy-release‚Äù pipeline set up.
While every pipeline might look a little bit different, they all have in common
that when one is put into practice it saves you hours of manual work each week.
My current favorite combination of CI/CD tools for Flutter is Github Actions +
Fastlane. This combo enables you to easily design workflows that can run on
different branches under different conditions. Example: when you merge a PR
development <-- feature branch, you can run dart analyzer / linter, tests,
generate docs, etc. when you merge a PR main <-- development branch, you can run
all the steps above, increments build/version number + run fastlane which builds
the release and deploys an internal release to both Google Play Store and App
Store. All this can finally happen without the pain of doing lots of manual
steps under a tight deadline (on a Friday evening). Enjoy your beer üç∫üåû
